# DOCUMENTATION

## Overview
This provided usecase is pursued to enhance overall Application development skills using **React, Javascript, HTML, CSS/SASS, Webpack etc**. To maximise learning, all required components have been **created from scratch** alongwith custom webpack setup.


## Development Outline
##### Week 1
- *Setup :* `Custom Webpack`, Github Repo, Folder Structure.
-  *Approach :* `Atomic Design`, Mobile First Approach, SASS(Mixins, Variables, Nesting), BEM structure in SASS.
- Worked on **Header component**.
- **Created Routes** and basic app page layout.

##### Week 2
- Worked on **Home page** layout and section card.
- **Created Atoms** like Button, Icon etc.
- Started with HTML **Semantics** and `A11y` using **NVDA**.
- `Locale and Multulingual` setup.


##### Week 3
- Worked on **Product page** layout and **Product card** and **Sidebar** components.
- **CSS Grid** implementation for both product listing and layout.
- Worked on **Footer** component. 
- Worked on **Dropdown** component for mobile view.
- Added some visibility updations and common utility functions.


##### Week 4
- Created **Cart page** for tablet and mobile view.
- Global state management setup using `Context API` (useContext/createContext hook)

- **Swipe functionality** in carousel for touchscreens.
- **Focus trap** for Dialog. 
- Created `Success flow` alongwith **user login/register check** and implementation.
- Improvements in the UI & refactoring of the code.
- `Deployment on netlify`.


## Optimization

##### Some of the optimizations done

- Global Sass Variables & Mixins for reusability
- Created Custom hooks for reusable functions
- Global state management (Context Api)
- Implemeted DRY (Do not repeat yourself) principle by creating util functions/components.
- Making site accessible using only Semantic Html.


## App Features
- Cart Dialog for Desktop view.
- Dropdown for mobile view.
- Swipe functionality in carousel for Touchscreens.
- Blocked background scroll when using Cart Dialog.
- Focus Trap for Dialog.
- Hover Tooltip for incomplete text.
- Customizable input features/validations for forms.
- Floating-labels.
- Customized scrollbar for chrome/safari.
- Locale and Multilingual with support for English/Hindi.
